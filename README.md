# Parta Ola 

A Python simulation of the retro Greek game "Πάρτα Όλα" (Take Them All), developed as part of a programming assignment.

## Game Description

"Parta Ola" is a game of luck played with a spinning wheel (like a top or roulette). Players take turns spinning and perform actions based on the result:

- **Put One / Put Two / Everyone Puts**: Beans go into the center pot.
- **Take One / Take Two / Take Them All**: Beans are removed from the pot and added to the player's stash.

Players who run out of beans are eliminated. The last player standing wins.

## Features

- Configurable number of players and starting beans.
- Randomized turn order.
- Full round-by-round updates.
- Elimination and win conditions.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python parta_ola.py
